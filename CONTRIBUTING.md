### Disclaimer
This is only a fun little project and I don't think it's worth contributing to, BUT:

### Contributing
If you want to help improve this project, feel free to create
- a [new issue](https://github.com/forgottosave/snash/issues/new/choose) to draw attention to bugs or missing features
- or [pull-request](https://github.com/forgottosave/snash/compare) with your own code changes. Improving code quality, or fixing some bugs is always useful :) 

### Code review
Sadly there is no guarantee that your PRs get merged, or if I will ever have time to look at them. But I'll try :)
